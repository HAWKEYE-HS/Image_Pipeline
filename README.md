# Image_Pipeline
The image pipeline takes raw image from sensor and convert it to meaningful image. Several algorithms like debayering, Black Level correction, auto-white balance, denoising.. will be first implemented to construct a meaningful image. Then additional algorithms can be implemented on the constructed image to post-process it. Like Flipping, blending and overlaying images. All algorithms will be implemented on a static raw image captured from a sensor. The first part of this project is similar to what happens in an ISP (Image Signal Processor) in which all algorithms are designed based on hardware, but we will be designing those such that they are hardware independent.
